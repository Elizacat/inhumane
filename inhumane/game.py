    raised. When the rules are broken, :py:exc:`~inhumane.game.RuleError` is
    raised. Note that all forms of cheating are not caught (and you could cheat
    by setting attributes anyway).

    :ivar name:
        The name of the game. Can be freeform.

    :ivar blackcards:
        A ``deque`` holding the present set of black cards from the deck.

    :ivar whitecards:
        A ``deque`` holding the present set of white cards from the deck.

        The black discard pile.

        An ``OrderedDict`` of players who have voted this round and the player
        they have voted for, if voting is enabled. This is subject to change.

    :ivar votes:
        A ``Counter`` containing the total number of votes players have
